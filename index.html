    <p style="font-weight:bold">What’s this tool for?</p>
    <p>
      Where’s Welly is a tool for understanding where in the Well you are. Wellington is famous for its hills. What is less famous
      is the impact those hills have on how long it takes to get from one place to another. Where’s Welly answers that question.
      Using the tool you can pick a spot on the map and see everywhere you can get to within 15 minutes. You can filter by
      mode of transport, time of day, day of the week. We also provide a layer of resources which you can switch on/off to
      see what destinations you can reach.

      up the graph to see how much time different ways of getting around will take.
